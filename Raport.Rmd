## Measures

For the assessment of the model in our experiment we will use three commonly known measures:

1.  **AUC - Area Under ROC Curve**     
 
An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph that shows the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters:
TPR (True Positive Rate) and FPR (False Positive Rate), defined as:

  $TPR=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
    
  $FPR=\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$
 
2.  **BAC - BAlanced Accuracy**
 
 This measure is a weighted accuracy, that is more suitable for datasets with imbalanced classes. 
 
3. **FNR - False Negative Rate**
 
It corresponds to the number of cases where model incorrectly fails to indicate the presence of a condition when it is present, divided by the number of all.

  $FNR=\frac{FN}{TP+FN}$

## Models

To identify the models, that could potentially be efficient classificators on this dataset, we measured the AUC, Balanced Accuracy and False Negative Rate measures on 6 different classification models from `mlr` package:


- **Ranger** - 
Random regression forest

- **Ada** - 
Adaptive Boosting

- **Binomial** - 
Binomial Regression

- **GBM** - 
Gradient Boosting Machine

- **Naive Bayes** - 
Naive Bayes

- **Random Forest** - 
Random Forest



## Explanations (Karol)

In this section we will take time to investigate some model explanations that we will be using later. Feel free to use this chapter as reference for quick overview. For more in-depth knowledge please refer to paper [_Explanatory Model Analysis_](https://ema.drwhy.ai/InstanceLevelExploration.html) [1] by professor Biecek. //bookdown?? TODO
All images in this section are also taken from this article.

### Local

Local explanations allow us to better understand model's prediction from the level of single observations. This can be useful when we want to evaluate predictions for certain instances. For example, which values have the most importance for the particular observations, or how the change in variables would impact the result. Local explanations combined with professional expertise could sometimes hint towards potential problems with the model in case they contradict each other. 

#### Break Down

In this explanation all observations start from the same base that is the mean prediction for all data. Next steps consist of fixing consecutive variables on values from the observation in question and measuring the change in mean prediction that is now calculated with some of the values fixed. This shift in mean prediction is interpreted as the impact of this variable's value on prediction for this observation. Figure TODO shows the corresponding steps.

![Figure: Panel A shows the distribution and mean prediction with values on the same level and above fixed on values from observation. Then change in mean is calculated and assigned to corresponding variables.](./images/2-4-break_down_distr.png){width=50%}

A big drawback for this method is how the order of variable can influence the explanation outcome. This problem occurs most often as a result of existing interactions between variables as seen in OBRAZEK TODO

![Figure: Variables age and class interact with each other so the changing order results in different plots](./images/2-4-ordering.png){width=50%}

#### Shap

Shap is a direct response to the biggest problem of Break Down method that is the ordering chosen for explanation could alter the results as seen in figure TODO. Shap takes a number of permutation and calculates the average response of Break Down on these permutations. More permutations result in more stable explanations. Exemplary output is shown in figure TODO.

#### Lime

The essence of Lime is to locally approximate the black box model with a glass box one. Then we can use it for local explanations that should yield results appropriate for the black box. Firstly, we generate data "close" to our observation (also called Point of Interest) and make predictions with black box model. Based on those predictions we try to fit the glass box model that accurately predicts those observations. In result we receive a glass box model that should behave the same as original model as long as we remain close to the Point of interest. Figure TODO describes the idea.

![Figure: Colored areas correspond to different prediction for the black box model. Black cross is our Point of Interest and circles are generated data. The line represents our simpler model that approximates original model around Point of Interest](./images/2-4-lime_introduction.png "Lime"){width=50%}

This method is often used for datasets consisting of many variables. Methods like Break down and Shap come out short in these situations.

#### Ceteris Paribus

Ceteris Paribus is a Latin phrase meaning "all else unchanged". This accurately describes what it does. For the certain observation we take values that are interesting to us and observe how the prediction changes as we change values in those columns one at a time. This can yield interesting conclusions about change in values and its impact on predictions. Figures TODO and TODO show prediction change as response for variable change.

![Figure: Shape of lines resembles the nature of the model. Dot shows value and model's prediction for the observation.](./images/2-4-titanicCeterisProfile01E-1.png){width=50%}



![Figure: Ceteris Paribus shows different importance in variables and their changes for different observations.](./images/2-4-titanicCeterisProfile01D-1.png){width=50%}

Ceteris Paribus is very popular due to its simplicity and interpretability. The biggest drawback however is the possibility of unpredictable or misleading results. For example, with fixed variable age set to 18, predicting outcome for a significant number of pregnancies does not make sense. It is also hard to capture interactions when working with variables separately.

### Global

As the name implies in global explanations we look at variables from the perspective of whole dataset. We can check the importance of variable for the model or analyze average impact of certain values on predictions.

#### Feature Importance

The main idea behind Feature Importance is measuring how important each variable is for model's predictions. To do that we measure the change in AUC after permutating values of each variable. The bigger the change, the bigger importance of variable. To stabilize the results, we can measure average change for a number of permutations. In figure TODO we can see that variable gender is the most important for model's prediction.

![Figure: Feature Importance output for 10 permutations.](./images/2-4-TitanicRFFeatImp10-1.png){width=50%}


#### Partial Dependence

To put it short, Partial Dependence is the average of Ceteris Paribus for whole data. This results in average importance and impact of variable and its values. The similarities can be observed in figure TODO

![Figure: Multiple observations with Ceteris Paribus and their average as Partial Dependence.](./images/2-4-pdpIntuition-1.png){width=50%}


As we can see observations can return different shapes for Ceteris Paribus, hence averaging them could mean loss of information. To answer this problem Partial Dependence implements grouping and clustering that could show the difference as shown in figure TODO.

![Figure: Partial Dependence grouped by sex.](./images/2-4-pdpPart5-1.png){width=50%}

As in Ceteris Paribus this method is very simple and understandable. However, it also carries over the same problems resulting from correlated variables.

#### Accumulated Dependence

Also referred as Accumulated-Local Dependence. It is the direct answer for correlation issue in Partial Dependence. The construction of Accumulated Dependence is the same as in Ceteris Paribus. The only difference being how the observations are summarized. Partial Dependence uses marginal distribution while Accumulated Dependence uses conditional distribution. This means that when there are at most negligible correlations, Accumulated Dependence yields results very similar to Partial Dependence.


# Results

## Model comparison

The models were checked on both `original` and `skip` dataset version, with the following results:

### Data Original

![](./images/2-4-data-original.png){width=50%}

The measure values between models are very similar, however, 

### Data Skip
![](./images/2-4-data-skip.png){width=50%}

Based on the results, two models: Ranger and Ada were chosen for further analysis. Hyperparameter tuning using random grid search was performed, resulting in classificators with the following values:


**Ranger**

 - num.trees=776, 
 - mtry=1,
 - min.node.size=8
 - splitrule="extratrees"
 
**Ada**
 - loss='logistic'
 - type='discrete',
 - iter=81,
 - max.iter=3,
 - minsplit=45, 
 - minbucket=4, 
 - maxdepth=1
 

## Explanations results

### Global

#### Variable Importance

Figure TODO shows Feature Importance for booth Ada and Ranger models. As we can see, booth agree with each other as to what variables are most important to them. Their predictions are mostly based on the values of *plas* variable and then *mass* and *age* come second.

![Figure: Variable importance for Ada and Ranger based on AUC loss after permutations.](./images/2-4-variable-importance.png){width=50%}

#### Partial Dependence Profile

Partial Dependence profile seen in figure TODO give us perhaps the most interesting results. Firstly, they are adequate to Feature importance in Figure TODO. The more important variables return wider range of average prediction and less important give less varied predictions respectively. Secondly, we can observe the difference in model's inner characteristics based on the shape of theirs PDP functions. Ada is more edgy and straight while ranger more smooth. 
Based on results yielded by PDP and according to these two models we can conclude that, generally speaking the bigger the values the higher the chance of positive Diabetes test result.

Some other key observations include: 

* Little to none impact by change of _age_ after 35 years of living.
* A sudden increase in prediction with _mass_ reaching 30 being the border of obesity in BMI model.
* Almost no change for ada prediction with change of _pedi_.
* A big increase in prediction with 7th pregnancy.

#### Accumulated Dependence Profile

Accumulated Dependence gave us similar results to Partial Dependence, thus we can conclude that our dataset does not contain any problematic correlations. Comparison between PD and AD is plotted on the Figure TODO for _mass_ variable.

# Discussion

## Expert opinion

There are two main types of diabetes:

- **type 1 diabetes**, where the body does not make insulin. It is mostly caused by genetic and environmental factors.

- **type 2 diabetes**, where the body does not make or use insulin well. It is the most common kind of diabetes. It is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.

Unfortunately, we do not have any data about the type of diabetes that was found among the patients in the investigated dataset. However, since type 2 diabetes is the most common type, and some of the factors causing the different types are common, we will focus mostly on the risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

### Causes of type 2 diabetes

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), type 2 diabetes can be caused by several factors:

- **obesity and physical inactivity**

Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. 

- **insulin resistance**

Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.

- **genes and family history**

As in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Genes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person‚Äôs tendency to become overweight or obese.

- **ethnicity**

Diabetes occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:
  - African Americans
  - Alaska Natives
  - American Indians
  - Asian Americans
  - Hispanics/Latinos
  - Native Hawaiians
  - Pacific Islanders
  
- **age**
Type 2 diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, but it can also affect children.

- **gestational diabetes**
Gestational diabetes is the type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors. Women with a history of gestational diabetes  have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

### Comparison

The causes of diabetes according to experts directly correspond with the columns is the explained dataset:

- `plas` - plasma glucose concentration, can indicate whether the patient suffers from a **insulin resistance**
- `mass` - Body Mass Index (BMI) can be one of the indicators whether patients **weight** puts him at risk for type 2 diabetes
- `age`- *older* people are generally more likely to develop diabetes
- `pedi` - pedigree function is meant to be an indicator of patient‚Äôs risk for diabetes based on his **genes and family history**
- `preg` - women that have been pregnant multiple times are more likely to develop **gestational diabetes**, and therefore, type 2 diabetes later in life.

Since all the women in the dataset have the same **ethnicity**, it is not a factor that can be considered valuable in this experiment.
